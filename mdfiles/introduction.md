## Introduction

This document outlines the engineering standards followed at [CirrusLabs](https://www.cirruslabs.io/) to ensure high-quality code, efficient development processes, and a collaborative working environment.

Engineering standards are established guidelines and specifications that ensure the quality, safety, and efficiency of products, processes, and services in the engineering field. 

Adhering to these standards helps maintain consistency, reliability, and interoperability across different projects and industries. 

Following engineering standards is crucial to minimize risks, enhance performance, and ensure regulatory compliance.
facilitate innovation and global collaboration by providing a common technical language.
