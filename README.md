## Introduction
This document outlines the engineering standards followed at [CirrusLabs](https://www.cirruslabs.io/) to ensure high-quality code, efficient development processes, and a collaborative working environment.

## Coding Standards
- [ ] Use [programming language/tool specific standards](#) for consistent code formatting and style.
- [ ] Follow best practices for error handling, variable naming, and function length.

### [Java](/Technology/Java/README.md)

### [JavaScript](/Technology//Javascript/README.md)

### [Python](/Technology//Python/README.md)

## Code Review Process
- [ ] All code changes must go through a code review process.
- [ ] Use [code review tool](#) for peer reviews and feedback.
- [ ] Address all comments and feedback before merging code into the main branch.

## Testing Standards
- [ ] Write unit tests for all new code.
- [ ] Write integration tests for critical functionalities.
- [ ] Use [testing framework/tool](#) for automated testing.

## Documentation
- [ ] Maintain [API documentation](#) for all public endpoints.
- [ ] Use [documentation tool](#) for generating and managing documentation.

## Version Control
- [ ] Use Git for version control.
- [ ] Follow [Git branching strategy](#) for managing code changes.
- [ ] Use [commit message guidelines](#) for clear and informative commit messages.

## Deployment Process
- [ ] Use [deployment tool](#) for automated deployments.
- [ ] Follow [deployment checklist](#) for ensuring smooth deployments.

## Security Practices
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Use [security tool](#) for vulnerability scanning and code analysis.

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile and optimize code for performance.
- [ ] Use [performance monitoring tool](#) for tracking and analyzing performance metrics.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
- [ ] Use [CI/CD tool](#) for automated build, test, and deployment processes.
- [ ] Implement [continuous integration](#) and [continuous deployment](#) pipelines for faster delivery.

## Feedback and Improvement
- [ ] Encourage feedback from team members to improve engineering standards.
- [ ] Regularly review and update these standards to reflect evolving best practices.
