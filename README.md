## Introduction
This document outlines the engineering standards followed at [CirrusLabs](https://www.cirruslabs.io/) to ensure high-quality code, efficient development processes, and a collaborative working environment.

## Coding Standards
- [ ] Use [programming language/tool specific standards](#) for consistent code formatting and style.
- [ ] Follow best practices for error handling, variable naming, and function length.

### Java
1. **Code Formatting**: 
   - Use a consistent indentation style (e.g., 4 spaces).
   - Use braces for all control structures, even if they are optional.
   - Limit lines to 80-120 characters.

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes.
   - Use camelCase for variables and methods, and UpperCamelCase for class names.

3. **Comments**:
   - Use comments to explain complex code or to provide context where necessary.
   - Follow Javadoc conventions for documenting classes, methods, and parameters.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Use try-catch blocks for handling exceptions.
   - Catch specific exceptions rather than general ones where possible.
   - Always include a meaningful message when throwing exceptions.

5. **Concurrency**:
   - Use synchronization or concurrent data structures for thread safety.
   - Avoid using `synchronized` on large blocks of code; use it only where necessary.

6. **Best Practices**:
   - Use interfaces and abstract classes to define contracts.
   - Minimize the use of static methods and variables.
   - Use enums for representing a fixed set of constants.

### JavaScript
1. **Code Formatting**:
   - Use a consistent indentation style (e.g., 2 or 4 spaces).
   - Use semicolons to end statements.
   - Use single quotes for strings unless double quotes are necessary.

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use camelCase for variables and function names.
   - Use PascalCase for class names.
   - Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the variable or function.

3. **Comments**:
   - Use comments to explain complex logic, especially if it's not immediately obvious.
   - Use JSDoc comments to document functions and their parameters.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Use try-catch blocks for handling exceptions.
   - Avoid using `throw` inside a `finally` block.
   - Always include a meaningful message when throwing exceptions.

5. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Use Promises or async/await for asynchronous operations.
   - Handle errors in asynchronous code using `.catch()` or `try-catch` with async/await.

6. **Best Practices**:
   - Use strict mode (`'use strict';`) to catch common coding mistakes.
   - Avoid using `eval()` and `with` as they can introduce security vulnerabilities.
   - Use `===` for equality comparisons to avoid type coercion.

### Python
1. **Code Formatting**:
   - Use 4 spaces for indentation.
   - Use snake_case for variable and function names.
   - Use CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
   - Limit lines to 79 characters.

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
   - Avoid using single-letter variable names except for iterators (e.g., `i`, `j`, `k`).

3. **Comments**:
   - Use comments to explain complex algorithms or to provide context where necessary.
   - Use docstrings to document functions, classes, and modules.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Use try-except blocks for handling exceptions.
   - Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic `except:` clause.
   - Always include a meaningful message when raising exceptions.

5. **Best Practices**:
   - Use list comprehensions and generator expressions instead of loops where possible.
   - Use context managers (`with` statement) for resource management.
   - Follow the PEP8 style guide for Python code.


## Code Review Process
- [ ] All code changes must go through a code review process.
- [ ] Use [code review tool](#) for peer reviews and feedback.
- [ ] Address all comments and feedback before merging code into the main branch.

## Testing Standards
- [ ] Write unit tests for all new code.
- [ ] Write integration tests for critical functionalities.
- [ ] Use [testing framework/tool](#) for automated testing.

## Documentation
- [ ] Maintain [API documentation](#) for all public endpoints.
- [ ] Use [documentation tool](#) for generating and managing documentation.

## Version Control
- [ ] Use Git for version control.
- [ ] Follow [Git branching strategy](#) for managing code changes.
- [ ] Use [commit message guidelines](#) for clear and informative commit messages.

## Deployment Process
- [ ] Use [deployment tool](#) for automated deployments.
- [ ] Follow [deployment checklist](#) for ensuring smooth deployments.

## Security Practices
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Use [security tool](#) for vulnerability scanning and code analysis.

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile and optimize code for performance.
- [ ] Use [performance monitoring tool](#) for tracking and analyzing performance metrics.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
- [ ] Use [CI/CD tool](#) for automated build, test, and deployment processes.
- [ ] Implement [continuous integration](#) and [continuous deployment](#) pipelines for faster delivery.

## Feedback and Improvement
- [ ] Encourage feedback from team members to improve engineering standards.
- [ ] Regularly review and update these standards to reflect evolving best practices.
