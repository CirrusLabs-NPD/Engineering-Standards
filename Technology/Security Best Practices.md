# Security Best Practices

## Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) involves analyzing the application's source code, byte code, or binary code for security vulnerabilities without executing the application. Key points about SAST include:

- SAST tools scan the codebase for potential security flaws such as injection vulnerabilities, insecure authentication, sensitive data exposure, and more.

- SAST examines the code structure, data flow, control flow, and dependencies to identify security weaknesses and coding errors.

- Common SAST tools include Checkmarx, Fortify Static Code Analyzer, Veracode Static Analysis, and SonarQube.

## Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) involves testing the running application from the outside to identify security vulnerabilities while the application is in operation. Key points about DAST include:

- DAST tools simulate attacks by sending malicious inputs (such as payloads for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF) to the application and observing how it responds.

- DAST focuses on identifying vulnerabilities that may arise from the application's runtime behavior, configuration, or interaction with external components.

- Common DAST tools include OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy), Burp Suite, Acunetix, and Qualys Web Application Scanning.

Both SAST and DAST have their strengths and limitations. While SAST is effective at identifying coding errors and vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, DAST provides a more realistic assessment of the application's security posture in a production-like environment.

Integrating SAST and DAST into the software development lifecycle can help organizations identify and mitigate security risks proactively. These scans should be performed regularly as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that security vulnerabilities are addressed early and continuously throughout the development process.

Additionally, it's essential to prioritize and remediate the identified security issues based on their severity, impact, and exploitability to effectively mitigate risks and protect the application from potential threats.

## Platforms for Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

### Fortify Static Code Analyzer

- Fortify Static Code Analyzer, part of Micro Focus Fortify, is a leading SAST tool that helps identify security issues in source code.
- It supports a broad range of languages and provides detailed reports with actionable insights.
- Fortify integrates with IDEs, build systems, and CI/CD pipelines to automate security testing and remediation.
